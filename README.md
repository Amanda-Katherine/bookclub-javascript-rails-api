# On The Same Page

On The Same Page is an application where book clubs can come together to find their next book. Members can suggest new books and vote on ones suggested. Future versions will include Club creation, Member login, and show when and where the next Meeting will be.

This is an SPA made with vanilla JavaScript on the frontend and a Rails API as the backend. Additional functionality includes Google Books API.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. cd into the backend via 'cd bookclub-backend-rails'
3. Run 'bundle install'
4. Run 'rails db:create:all'
5. Run 'rails db:migrate'
6. Run 'rails db:seed'
7. Run 'rails s' from the backend directory
8. Open the 'index.html' file in your browser. With a mac you can write 'open index.html' in your terminal from the frontend directory.
